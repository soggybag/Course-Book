# Course-Book

Course Book makes it easy to track students in a course, call on 
students randomly, and pair them into random groups. 

Test it live [here](http://webdevils.com/course-book/).

## Goals 

Course Book is meant to keep lists of students across any number of 
classes and give instructors a simple tool to call on students 
randomly and equally. Course Book makes a list of students ordered
randomly and will provide the next student's name until each has 
been chosen before regenerating the list. 

Course Book keeps a list of classes each with it's own list of 
student names.

Course Book stores course and student info locally. This means 
your information will always persist on the computer/browser 
where it was created. While you can't share information across
devices it does make Course Book simple and easy to deploy with 
no dependancies. 

Course Book is meant to be a simple library that can be integrated 
anywhere or used standalone with no need for logins and backend 
support.
